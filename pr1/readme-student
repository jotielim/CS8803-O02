# ECHO
Client
    1. Create a socket with the socket() system call
    2. Connect the socket to the address of the server using the connect() system call
    3. Send and receive data.

Server
    1. Create a socket with the socket() system call.
    2. Bind the socket to an address using the bind() system call. For a server socket on the Internet,
       an address consists of a port number on the host machine.
    3. Listen for connections with the listen() system call.
    4. Accept a connection with the accept() system call. This call typically blocks until a client connects
       with the server.
    5. Send and receive data.
