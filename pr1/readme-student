In general, the client/server works as follow:

Client
    1. Create a socket with the socket() system call
    2. Connect the socket to the address of the server using the connect() system call
    3. Send and receive data.

Server
    1. Create a socket with the socket() system call.
    2. Bind the socket to an address using the bind() system call. For a server socket on the Internet,
       an address consists of a port number on the host machine.
    3. Listen for connections with the listen() system call.
    4. Trigger infinite loop to continuously listen
    5. Accept a connection with the accept() system call. This call typically blocks until a client connects
       with the server.
    6. Send and receive data.

For the single threaded gflib, the client/server works the same as above. The client sends a request
GETFILE GET /path/to/file\r\n\r\n to the server. Then, the server reply back with response
GETFILE OK 12345\r\n\r\n_the_bytes_being_sent_

For the multi threaded mtgf server, we initialize the number of threads can be used by the server. The boss is
adding jobs to the pool. When the pool is empty, we wait until it's no longer empty. When a job is being added
to the pool, we signal the waiting condition so that the workers continue to process the response.

For the multi threaded mtgf client, we initialize the number of threads that can be used by the client. For each
of the threads, we make n request concurrently.
