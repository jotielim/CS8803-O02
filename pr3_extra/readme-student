#Project 3

##Extra Credit

I combined pr1 and pr3. The underlying concept is still the same as pr3 part 2 except using source code from pr1 for
the gfclient_download. I replace the gfserver.o with the source code from pr1 and modify webproxy so it uses that
code base.

To compile, use `make clean && make all`. It will produce three executables `webproxy`, `simplecached`, and
`gfclient_download`.
